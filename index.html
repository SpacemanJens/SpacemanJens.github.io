    Note: This was made by using vibe coding using model "Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp". After looping some error messages I got a working game. Her is a

    Note: The star system was generated using vibe coding and the other logic was made with copilot assistance.

    <br><br>
    The approach for finishing the game is to put all the code from the POC's in a new folder and make the copilot implement the features descriped in the todo one by one.
